PNID.app is a powerful tool for labeling and managing Process and Instrumentation Diagrams (P&IDs), designed to streamline the reading and analysis process for engineers and technicians in the process industry.

## Core Features

- **Project Management**: Create and organize projects using images or PDF files of P&IDs.
- **Intuitive Labeling**: Easily label P&IDs with different categories of components.
- **Metadata Management**: Add and edit metadata for labeled components.
- **Public Sharing**: Generate public views for each labeled P&ID.
- **AI-Assisted Predictions**: Utilize machine learning for automated metadata suggestions.
- **Export Functionality**: Export labeled P&IDs to PDF format.

## Usage
This application is available in two formats:

* **Online Version:** Access the app directly at [beta.pnid.app](beta.pnid.app). This version is hosted and maintained by our team and is meant for users who want to try it out immediately.
* **Self-Hosted Version:** For users who require more control over their data or need to integrate the app into their own infrastructure, we offer a self-hosted option. Follow the self-hosting guide in the next section to set up your own instance of the application.

Choose the option that best suits your needs and security requirements.

## Self-Hosting / Local Development

This project utilizes Supabase and Next.js, along with a Flask server for PDF export and an Express server for AI-assisted metadata parsing. For local development, we use the Supabase CLI to initialize a Supabase instance and can run each service individually or orchestrate them with Docker Compose.

> **For detailed instructions**, please refer to our comprehensive documentation in the [docs directory](./docs/README.md) which contains setup guides, development workflows, Docker instructions, and deployment procedures.

#### Prerequisites

- Supabase CLI
- Docker and Docker Compose (optional)
- Node.js and pnpm
- Python 3.11+ with pip 
- OpenAI API key (for metadata parsing)
- Resend API key (can use dummy for local development)

#### Quick Start Guide

1. **Start Supabase and initialize schema:**
   ```bash
   supabase start
   ./supabase/seed.sh
   ```

2. **Configure environment variables:**
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local`
   - Set your machine's IP address, Supabase keys, and API keys

3. **Run the services (using individual processes):**
   ```bash
   # Terminal 1: Next.js app
   pnpm install # First time only to ensure Next.js is installed
   pnpm dev
   
   # Terminal 2: Metadata parser
   cd companion/metadata-parser && PORT=7123 pnpm dev
   
   # Terminal 3: PDF export service (with Python virtual environment)
   cd companion/pdf-export
   python3 -m venv venv  # First time only
   source venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt  # First time only
   python main.py  # Will use port 6123 by default
   ```

4. **Alternative: Run with Docker Compose:**
   ```bash
   # Standard configuration
   docker compose up --build
   
   # Development with hot reloading
   docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up
   ```

   **Note for macOS users**: If you encounter port conflicts with port 5000 (used by AirPlay Receiver), either disable AirPlay Receiver in System Settings or use the individual process method above with explicit port settings.

5. **Access the application:**
   Open `http://{YOUR_IP_ADDRESS}:3000` in your browser

#### Key Environment Variables
