# Multi-page Support Implementation Testing Guide

## Initial Layout Changes

The multi-page interface has been significantly redesigned to create a more intuitive user experience:

1. Editor Layout - Now follows a side-by-side pattern:
   - Left: ReactFlow canvas (main area for PNID viewing/editing)
   - Right: Combined sidebar with node list on top, page navigation on bottom
   
2. Viewer Layout - Streamlined for viewing:
   - Left: ReactFlow canvas (maximized for viewing)
   - Right: Compact page navigation sidebar

## Testing Scenarios

### 1. First-time Experience
- Load a PNID document that has no pages
- Check that initialization works correctly - should create a default page
- Add a shape to verify page functionality
- Check that the node appears on the correct page

### 2. Page Navigation
- Create 3+ pages via the Add Page button
- Navigate between pages using arrow buttons
- Confirm each page shows correct nodes
- Check that viewport is preserved when switching back to a page

### 3. Page Management
- Rename a page
- Delete a page (verify associated nodes are removed)
- Reorder pages using the up/down buttons
- Verify the order is preserved after refresh

### 4. Thumbnail View
- Open thumbnail view using grid button
- Check compact mode in viewer
- Check regular mode in editor
- Verify clicking a thumbnail loads the correct page

### 5. Cross-page Elements
- Mark an element as cross-page
- Verify it appears on the export view with special indicator

### 6. Responsive Design
- Test on different screen sizes
- Check compact view handles small screens
- Verify thumbnails adjust based on available space

## Known Limitations

- Thumbnail view doesn't show actual thumbnails yet, just placeholders
- First-time page creation requires a page refresh for node list to fully update
- Viewport persistence doesn't work perfectly in some edge cases
